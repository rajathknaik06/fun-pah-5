""" Sophia manages payroll at a local business where employees are paid based on the number of hours they work each month. She needs to calculate the monthly salary for each employee, considering a fixed hourly rate and standard deductions. The deductions amount to 15% of the gross salary.



Help Sophia write a program that calculates the net monthly salary for each employee. The program should read the total hours worked and the hourly rate from the input, compute the gross salary, apply the deductions, and then output the net salary.



Example

Input

40

12.50



Output 

Hours Worked: 40.0 hours

Hourly Rate: 12.50 per hour

Net Salary: 425.00



Explanation

The gross salary is calculated as 40.0 hours * 12.50/hour = 500.0

The deductions are 15% of the gross salary, which is 0.15 * 500.00 = 75.00

The net salary is gross - deductions = 500.0 - 75.0 = 425.00.



Function Signature: monthly_salary(hours_worked, hourly_rate)

Input format :
The first line contains a positive floating-point number representing the number of hours worked by the employee.

The second line contains a positive floating-point number representing the hourly rate for the employee.

Output format :
The first line displays the number of hours worked in the format "Hours Worked: {hours} hours," where {hours} is the actual number of hours worked with two decimal places.

The second line displays the hourly rate in the format "Hourly Rate: {rate} per hour," where {rate} is the actual hourly rate rounded to two decimal places.

The third line displays the net salary in the format "Net Salary: {salary}," where {salary} is the actual net salary rounded to two decimal places.
